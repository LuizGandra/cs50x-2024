## Filter (Less)
Implement a program in C to apply filters to BMPs. Implement the functions in helpers.c such that a user can apply grayscale, sepia, refletion or blur filters to their images.
*To test this code, download the remaining files from the link below.*

- The function grayscale should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
- The function sepia should take an image and turn it into a sepia version of the same image.
- The reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.
- Finally, the blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.

## Filter (More)
Implement a program in C to apply filters to BMPs. Implement the functions in helpers.c such that a user can apply grayscale, reflection, blur, or edge detection filters to their images.
*To test this code, download the remaining files from the link below.*

- The function grayscale should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
- The reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.
- The blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
- The edges function should take an image and highlight the edges between objects, according to the Sobel operator.
