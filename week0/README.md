# Problem Set 0

## Starting From Scratch
Implement in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) any project of your choice, subject only to the following requirements:

- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and [Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433).

### Solution
[**Scratch-Man**](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/946420942), a small version of the classic Pac-Man in Scratch.

**How to play:** press arrow keys to move. If you touch walls or enemies, you will take damage. If you get all the points on the map before losing 3 HPs you win!
